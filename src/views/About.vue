            <p>Stemformatics is a well-established platform for biomedical research that has a mix of old and new software and architecture.  We have several projects that will expose GSoC students to a production database model, whilst giving us the opportunity to introduce new approaches to refactor, harmonise and expand the Stemformatics platform.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The types of biological data being handled by Stemformatics is changing rapidly, and user expectations are also evolving. We would like to bring some fresh visualisation approaches to the platform to address this complex data. Therefore, we are looking for creative as well as technical partnerships.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>We are interested in participating in the wider GSoC community, and we see strong benefits for our whole team in participating in student training and being exposed to other teams and approaches to data mining and visualisation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Stemformatics fulfils an educational purpose, itâ€™s client base includes expert stem cell researchers, the broader scientific research network including biostatisticians and computational biologists. We are interested in expanding this to include the software engineering community and the broader public interested in stem cell science.</p>
